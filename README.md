# Brainee Classifier  

**Brainee Classifier** is a full-stack AI-powered system for brain tumor classification. It leverages deep learning with **VGG19 transfer learning** to classify medical images accurately and efficiently. The project includes a backend API built with **Flask** and a modern **React-based web application**, creating an interactive interface for users.

## Features  
- **AI-Powered Classification**: Uses VGG19 transfer learning for high accuracy.  
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Flask backend connected to a React frontend for seamless user experience.  
- **Custom Data Pipeline**: Handles image preprocessing, augmentation, and loading.  
- **Advanced Training Optimization**: Incorporates callbacks like early stopping and learning rate adjustment.  
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displays predictions, confusion matrices, and performance metrics.  
- **Deployment-Ready**: The model is saved as a reusable `.h5` file for real-world applications.

## Usage  
1. Upload a brain scan image through the React web app.  
2. The image is sent to the Flask backend for preprocessing and classification.  
3. The model predicts the tumor type and displays the result on the frontend.

## Visualizations  
- **Model Performance**: Training/validation accuracy and loss curves.  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displays prediction metrics for each class.  
- **Prediction Analysis**: Visual comparison of true vs. predicted labels.
